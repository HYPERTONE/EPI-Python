# Strings are ubiquitous in programming today - scripting, web development, and bioinformatics all make extensive use of strings.

# You should know how strings are represented in memory, and understand basic operations on strings such as comparison,
# copying, joining, splitting, matching, etc. Advanced string processing algorithms often use hash tables (Chapter 12) and
# dynamic programming (Page 234).

# A palindromic string is one which reads the same when it is reversed.


# 6.1 - Interconvert Strings And Integers


# Implement an integer to string conversion function, an da string to integer conversion function. For example, if the input to the first
# function is the integer 314, it should return the string '314' and if the input to the second function is the string '314' it should
# return the integer 314.
