# Write a program that performs base conversion. The input is a string, an integer b1, and another integer b2. The string
# represents an integer in base b1. The output should be the string representing the integer in base b2. 

# For example, if the string is '615', b1 is 7 and b2 is 13, then the result should be '1A7', 
# since 6 x 7^2 + 1 x 7 + 6 = 1 x 13^2 + 10 x 13 + 7.
