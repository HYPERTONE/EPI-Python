# Strings are ubiquitous in programming today - scripting, web development, and bioinformatics all make extensive use of strings.

# You should know how strings are represented in memory, and understand basic operations on strings such as comparison,
# copying, joining, splitting, matching, etc. Advanced string processing algorithms often use hash tables (Chapter 12) and
# dynamic programming (Page 234).

# A palindromic string is one which reads the same when it is reversed.
