# Binary search commonly asks for the index of any element of a sorted array that is equal to a specified element.

# Write a method that takes a sorted array and a key and returns the index of the first occurrence of that key in the array. 
# For example, given <-14, -10, 2, 108, 108, 243, 285, 285, 285, 401> the method should return 3 when given key 108 and 6 when given key 285.
