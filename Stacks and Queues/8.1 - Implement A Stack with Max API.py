# Stacks support last-in, first-out semantics for inserts and deletes, whereas queues are first-in, first-out. Stacks and
# queues are usually building blocks in a solution to a complex problem.

# A stack supports two basic operations - push and pop. Elements are added (pushed) and removed (popped) in last-in, 
# first-out order. If the stack is empty, pop typically returns null or throws an exception.


# 8.1 - Implement A Stack With Max API

# Design a stack that includes a max operation, in addition to push and pop. The max method should return the maximum
# value stored in the stack.
