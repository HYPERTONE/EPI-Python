# A heap is a specialized binary tree - specifally a complete binary tree (meaning all levels are completely filled 
# except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible).

# The keys must satisfy the heap property - the key at each node is at least as great
# as the keys stored at its children.

# A heap is sometimes referred to as a priority queue because it behaves like a queue, with one difference: each element has a 
# 'priority' associated with it, and deletion removes the element with the highest priority.
