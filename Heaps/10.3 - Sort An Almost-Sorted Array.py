# Often data is almost sorted - for example, a server receives timestamped stock quotes and earlier quotes may arrive slightly
# after later quotes because of differences in sever loads and network routes.

# Write a program which takes as input a very long sequence of numbersd and prints the numbers in sorted order.
# Each number is at most k away from its correctly sorted position. For example, no number in the sequence <3,-1,2,6,4,5,8>
# is more than 2 away from its final sorted position.
